I expect to gain a strong foundational understanding of Python programming, including core concepts like data types, control structures, functions, and modules. I'm also looking forward to learning about real-world applications of Python in fields like data analysis, automation, and web development. Since this workshop is being held at IIT Bhilai, I?m excited to learn from experienced mentors and explore advanced topics such as libraries like NumPy, Pandas, or even basics of machine learning if included. Overall, I aim to enhance my problem-solving skills using Python and apply it effectively in both academic projects and real-world scenarios.
","I?m most interested in the applications of data science in healthcare, education, and social media analytics, as these directly impact people?s lives and daily experiences.  In healthcare, data science can help predict disease outbreaks, personalize treatment plans, and improve diagnostics using patient data ? something that can literally save lives.  In education, data analytics can help track student performance, identify learning gaps, and build personalized learning paths ? which I find relevant as a student myself, and I believe I can contribute here by developing smarter education tools.  Another area is social media analytics ? using data to understand trends, mental health patterns, or even to detect misinformation. As someone active online, I see how this can shape public opinion and behavior.  I?m passionate about applying data science not just to solve problems but to create meaningful impact in communities I?m part of."
